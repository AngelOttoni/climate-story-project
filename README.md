# Climate Story Project

## **About the Challenge**

- **Over the last several decades, a huge amount of climate data from numerous sources has been collected. This data is freely available to the public, but making sense of this vast amount of data is not easy! Your challenge is to use the open-source data on the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center website to tell a compelling story about climate change.**
